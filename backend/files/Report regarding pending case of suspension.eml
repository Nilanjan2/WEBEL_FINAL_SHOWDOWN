Respected Madam/Sir
As per your requirement on the Note issued by Higher Education department, Govt. of West Bengal bearing Memo No. 21-Pr.Secy-HED/24 Dt. 29-08-24 I am pleased to state that our institution has no pending case of suspension of any employee as of today, but an employee of our institution PROF. AMIRUL KHAN, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN ENGLISH (Date of joining- 21/04/2017), was suspended from 25.10.2017, but then as per court order (ACJM, Bolpur) and GB resolution, his suspension was withdrawn and he was reinstated in his service on 27/07/2020. But he has not been approved of any salary during the period before his suspension and during his whole suspension. I, hence,&nbsp; humbly request to you to&nbsp; please look into this matter and approve and grant all his dues and financial benefits as early as possible. The summary of the case of Prof. Amirul Khan is as follows:

Details of the Employee, Prof. Amirul Khan, Department of English, Birbhum Mahavidyalaya, Date of joining- 21/04/2017
&nbsp;	Prof. Amirul Khan was absent without any intimation to the College authority from 25/10/2017.	Prof. Khan was suspended on and from 29/12/2017 with immediate effect as he was in Police custody since 25/10/2017.	He was acquitted by the learned court ACJM, Bolpur, Birbhum on 12/09/2019. 	The Governing Body withdrew Prof. Khan&rsquo;s suspension on 22/07/2020 &amp; Prof. Khan rejoined his service on 27/07/2020 after receiving the intimation letter from the Principal on 27/07/2020. 	The Governing Body in its meeting held on 31/12/2020 resolves to amend its earlier resolution regarding the suspension period of Prof. Khan and decides to effect the suspension from 25/10/2017 till its withdrawal. 	His service was confirmed from the very first date of his joining, i.e., 21/04/2017, as resolved by the Governing Body on 31/12/2020.	As per the statute of the Burdwan University, &ldquo;When the suspension of an employee is held to have been unjustifiable or not wholly justifiable, or when an employee who had been suspended, removed or dismissed from service is reinstated, the competent authority shall grant to him for the period of his absence from duty&mdash; (i) if he is honorably acquitted, all financial benefit including promotion due, if any, as if he had not been suspended, dismissed or removed.&rdquo; and &ldquo;In a case falling under clause (i) of sub-paragraph (e), the entire period of absence from duty shall be treated as the period spent on duty.&rdquo; 	The College submitted bill regarding his allowance, but no allowance has been approved during the suspension period. He has not been approved of any salary during the period before his suspension and the whole suspension period. Therefore, it is humbly requested to approve and grant all due financial benefits to Prof. Amirul Khan.
